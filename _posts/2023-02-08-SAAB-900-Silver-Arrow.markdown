# SAAB 900 Silver Arrow

During the making of the Saab 900 Classic, some limited edition models came out, including the "Silver Arrow". This edition was just for the Dutch market and all Silver Arrows were delivered as silver 2-door sedans with Silver Arrow stripes and 15-inch Turbo 85 alloy wheels.

The inside of the car was made with personal touches, like a numbered sign on the glove box, a wooden steering wheel, and the first owner's initials on the gear knob. The Silver Arrow had a 2.0 8v turbo engine without a catalytic converter and could produce 155hp. It only came with a manual GM 45610 gearbox. 

They made 150 Silver Arrows to start with and later made 50 more.
