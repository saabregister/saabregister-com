# SAAB 900 Red Arrow

The Saab 900 Red Arrow is a limited edition sports car produced by the Swedish automaker Saab in 1987. This car was designed to commemorate Saab's 40th anniversary and pay homage to their first car, the Ursaab. The Red Arrow was created as a high-performance version of the Saab 900 Turbo, offering drivers a unique and exhilarating driving experience.

The Red Arrow was based on the Saab 900 Turbo and was fitted with numerous upgrades to enhance its performance and style. It was fitted with a 2.0-liter turbocharged engine that produced an impressive 177 horsepower, making it one of the most powerful cars in its class. The engine was coupled with a five-speed manual transmission that provided smooth and responsive shifting. The Red Arrow also featured sport-tuned suspension, larger brakes, and wider tires to provide better handling and braking performance.

On the outside, the Red Arrow was finished in a striking red color that was complemented by a set of distinctive silver-painted wheels. The car also featured a red "arrow" graphic on the front and rear, adding to its sporty appearance. The interior of the Red Arrow was also upgraded, with comfortable leather sport seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and a premium sound system.

Despite its high performance and stylish design, the Saab 900 Red Arrow was produced in limited quantities, with only 1,500 units being made. This exclusivity has made the Red Arrow highly sought after by Saab enthusiasts and collectors. The Red Arrow is considered to be one of the best performance cars produced by Saab, and its unique combination of power, style, and exclusivity has helped it to become a true classic.

In conclusion, the Saab 900 Red Arrow was a special and limited edition sports car that celebrated Saab's 40th anniversary and offered drivers a unique and exhilarating driving experience. With its powerful engine, upgraded suspension, and stylish design, the Red Arrow remains a highly sought after car among Saab enthusiasts and collectors.
