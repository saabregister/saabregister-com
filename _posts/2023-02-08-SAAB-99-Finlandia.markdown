# SAAB 99 Finlandia

The SAAB 99 Finlandia Prototype was manufactured in 1976 at the Uusikaupunki car factory. It was based on the conventional SAAB 99 Combi-Coupé and had a body that was extended by 25 centimeters through the addition of an extension piece in the center. The model acquired the nickname "saunanikkuna" (meaning "sauna window") due to the small additional window located between the doors. In 1977, production of the lengthened SAAB 99 commenced, with a total of 23 Finlandias produced.

The following year in 1978, the model underwent further development and the "sauna window" was removed. Both front and rear doors were extended by 10 centimeters each, resulting in an overall length that was 20 centimeters longer than a standard Combi-Coupé.
